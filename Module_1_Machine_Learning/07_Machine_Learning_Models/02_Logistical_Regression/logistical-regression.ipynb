    "Logistic regression is used to model the relationship between two or more variables (1 dependent and 1 or more independent). The main difference between logistic and linear regression is that the dependent variable in logistic regression is binary (yes or no). The most common examples of its use are predictions or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of predicting house prices, we can consider different independent variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of rooms\n",
    "- Square meters\n",
    "- Number of floors\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent variable could be whether the house price is expensive or not, making our dependent variable binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression helps us in this case to predict if the house price is very high or not. Based on these variables, we analyze a certain amount of data (the more, the better) to find a relationship and answer the question of whether the price is high or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercise, we can see how dependent and independent variables work, the division between training and test data, and also see the model's result and the accuracy of the predictions.\n",
